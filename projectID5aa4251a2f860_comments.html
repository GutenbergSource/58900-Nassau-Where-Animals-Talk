<HTML><BODY>A collection of West African Animal Stories from Equatorial Guinea.

<p>The collection is divided into three parts representing the Mpongwe (living near Libreville), Benga (living on Corisco Island), and Fang peoples (who live throughout Equatorial Guinea and in neighboring regions in Cameroon and Gabon).

<p>A few accents (including breve marks) to represent Bantu words, but no further difficulties. 

<p>Have Fun!

<p>P.S. Scans are available <a href="https://archive.org/details/whereanimalstalk00nassuoft">here</a>.</BODY></HTML>
